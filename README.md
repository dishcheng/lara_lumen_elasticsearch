lara_lumen_elasticsearch
=====
The project inspired by [elasticquent/Elasticquent](https://github.com/elasticquent/Elasticquent/) ,but it didn't support elasticSearch 7.x now.

I don't suggest use in production now . Just tested in lumen6.x + elasticSearch 7.x.

Project based on [elastic/elasticsearch-php](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/tree/7.x)
